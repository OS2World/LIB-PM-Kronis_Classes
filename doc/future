Here are my plans for future releases (no promises, however)

- general:
  + less bugs
  + nicer source code
  + more comments

- near future:
  + Complete reference guide
  + include *all* features in demo programs
  + let KrCommonTextOutput inherit from ostream
  + re-write graphics classes (current constructors too complicated)

- far future:
  + more graphics objects
  + more built-in input dialog features
  + get rid of the templates
  + more extensive user's guide
  + link the library as a DLL (currently, the code is so small
                               that this does not pay off)

If you have other good ideas, please let me know!
